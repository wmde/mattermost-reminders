**Wikibase Product Platform "Asynchronous Daily Friday" - ${TODAY}**

Dear @prpl Team Members, it is Friday, so today we do a daily asynchronously. Please share your contributions by answering in this thread.
Please share your "stand up updates". Feel also free to indicate any topics you'd like to find some clarifications on today, quick decisions you'd like to see made, and any other topics you'd mention in the "Extended Daily" part of a synchronous Daily.
Stand up update questions:
* What did you do yesterday?
* What will you do today?
* What are you blockers (impediments)? Ask who can help you!

Ideally share your updates by 11 AM Berlin time.
Thank you and have a good weekend!
